## How to use
### Colab
***NOTE: PyQt5 UI는 사용환경에 따라 실행시간에 차이가 클 수 있습니다. 또한 영상실행 단계에서 코덱 issue가 발생할 수 있어 fishChcker algorithm 결과를 어떤 사용환경에서도 확인해보실 수 있도록 Colab test version를 지원하고 있습니다.***

1. Download the ZIP file from the link below

   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ixf9Td-opkCBDDwDRdwEQicY2Ljvy700/view?usp=sharing 

2. Unzip the downloaded file and upload it to My Drive in Google Drive.

3. For faster execution, change the runtime type to GPU and run all shells


<br><br>


### PyQt5 UI
1. Install the codec from the link below for smooth execution in the video execution stage of the UI

   https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm 

2. Download the EXE file and run it

   ***NOTE: Please make sure that all paths do not contain Korean characters.***

3. If you want to directly create and run the executable file or run main.py directly from the shell, please match the versions of the packages you need.
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Future Direction of Algorithm Time Complexity Improvement
- It was intended to intuitively express that the process of predicting weight through the brute force algorithm is realistically possible > If we add the step of narrowing the range of rotation angle by looking at the aspect ratio of the bounding box, there is no need to look at all -90 to 90 degrees.
- The model load is carried out 3 times, but this can be reduced to 2  (Because the model used in the process of selecting the bestframe and the process of finding the length of the fish in the bestframe is the same)
- Since the length of the video used for the demo is 5 seconds, we calculated quite a lot of frames. Considering the cycle of flopping of live fish, it is judged that the weight can be predicted sufficiently even with an image for 1 to 2 seconds.
- Process after selecting the bestframe  (finding the length of the fish in the bestframe, finding the thickness of the handle in the bestframe) parallel processing
- Reparameterization  (Before reparameterization, the model has more parameters and computation cost.)
